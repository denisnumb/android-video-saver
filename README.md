# Android Video Saver

ℹ️ The application allows you to save channels and videos from YouTube, view them in the built-in video player of the device, and also download videos

🛠️ The application is based on the python library [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) integrated with [`yausername/youtubedl-android`](https://github.com/yausername/youtubedl-android)

### In the application settings, you can specify the video quality when loading and downloading, as well as set up "cloud storage" using a file in the Github repository.

⁉️ **Using Github as cloud storage with an access token?**

🤔 *Yes, it's probably not the best idea, but at the time the app was being developed, that's what I personally needed, and it was the easiest option for me. In any case, it's unlikely that anyone would find the cloud storage functionality for syncing useful within the context of this app.*
